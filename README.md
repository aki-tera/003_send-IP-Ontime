# 003_send-IP&Ontime
end your IP-address & Ontime to LINE-Notify

***

1)This program can send your computer's Global IP address(IPv4) to your LINE notify.  
  So if you want to use LINE notify, Plese see ["https://notify-bot.line.me/"](https://notify-bot.line.me/).  

2)This program can get monotonic time durations of your computer.  
  I didn't program this.  
  I found this from 'stackoverflow.com' ["https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1205722/how-do-i-get-monotonic-time-durations-in-python"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1205722/how-do-i-get-monotonic-time-durations-in-python).
